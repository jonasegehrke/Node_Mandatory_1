        <h3 class="content-main-heading">Tools for Node.js</h1>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>In this elective we've used a few tools that have come in handy for backend web-development</p>

            <h4 id="express">Express</h4>
            <p>Express is a Node.js web application framework that provides a set of features for web
                applications. <br>
                It is fast, robust and asynchronous. Because of this, it is the leading backend framework for
                Node</p>

            <p>To install express you will require a version of Node and npm. You can install this from the <a
                    href="https://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> website</p>

            <p>In your project repository you will need to create a file called package.json with one simple
                line of code:</p>
            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-json" data-prismjs-copy="Copy to clipboard">{}
</code></pre>
            <p>With node installed and package.json created you will be able to do a simple terminal command to
                install express into your project <br>
                <code>npm install express</code>
            </p>

            <p>Express will now be installed and you can proceed to start your first express project. <br>
                Below will be an example of a simple web-application using nothing but express:</p>
            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript" data-prismjs-copy="Copy to clipboard">const express = require("express"); //import express with require
const app = express(); //Inititalize express and save it to a const

//Create a endpoint with parameters request & response
app.get("/", (req, res) =>{
    res.send("Hello World");    //Send a string to the web application
})

//Open the server on chosen port
app.listen(8080, () =>{ 
    console.log("Server is running on port ", 8080);
});
</code></pre>
            <h4>nodemon</h4>
            <p>nodemon is a great development tool. It watches all files in the project and provides an automatic restart when a file change is made.</p>
            <p>The install guide can found in <a href="/terminal-commands#nodemon">terminal commands</a></p>
            <p>You can create a config file for nodemon called <code>nodemon.json</code>. <br>
                A configuration that can come in handy when creating a SSR website would be the ability to specify an extension watch list: </p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-json" data-prismjs-copy="Copy to clipboard">{
    "ext": "js, json, html"
}
</code></pre>
            <p>Now nodemon will restart on any changes to files in the directory (or subdirectories) with the extensions <code>.js, .json, .html</code></p>
            <h4>Heroku</h4>
            <p>Heroku is a cloud platform that lets you build, deliver, monitor and scale apps.<br>
            You can easily host your express project for free with thier service </p>
            <p> A full guide to setting up your first Heroku app is specified on the <a href="/terminal-commands#heroku">terminal-commands</a> page</p>
