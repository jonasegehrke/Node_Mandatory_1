        <h3 class="content-main-heading">Terminal Commands</h1>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>This page includes all terminal commands that I've personally found helpful specifically for the
                Node.js elective. <br>
                This means that it will not include a lot of basic terminal commands such as
                <code>cd, ls, mkdir</code> and so on.
            </p>

            <h4>Node</h4>
            <p>Node is a runtime environment that contains a few commands itself which are useful for your workstation aswell as launching a
                program.</p>

            <p>The command below will tell you which version of node you currently have installed. <br>
                <code>node -v</code>
            </p>

            <p>For running a node file once you can use the command below. <br>
                <code>node &lt;FILE_TO_RUN&gt;</code>
            </p>

            <h4>npm</h4>
            <p>npm (Node package Manager) is the world's largest Software Registry. Open-source developers use
                npm to share software in a elegant and easy way <br>
                We use npm to install different software such as <code>express</code>.</p>

            <p>To install software such as express we use a simple command within our project repository. <br>
                <code>npm install express</code>
            </p>

            <p>In some cases we want to install software globally on our device so that we dont have to install
                it into every repository. <br>
                This is done with the <code>-g</code> option.<br>
                <code>npm install -g nodemon</code>
            </p>

            <h4 id="nodemon">nodemon</h4>
            <p>In the development phase you might want to auto-rerun your program whenever a change is made in
                your code. <br>
                This makes testing much easier to come during the journey</p>

            <p>To do this you have to install nodemon with npm. <br>
                <code> npm install -g nodemon</code></p>
                 
            <p>After this you can run your program on auto
                restart mode with the following command. <br>
                <code>nodemon.cmd &lt;FILE_TO_RUN&gt;</code>
            </p>

            <h4 id="heroku">Heroku</h4>
            <p>In case you want to publish an express project to the web you can make use of the free hosting
                service called Heroku <br>
                I will explain the path to creating an app with heroku and to push your repository to that app
            </p>
            <p>To install heroku to your device follow this <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up">link</a> and download the Heroku CLI</p>
            <p>First you have to add a few changes to your express project:</p>
            <p>Add a script to start your project in the package.json file</p>
            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-json" data-prismjs-copy="Copy to clipboard">"scripts": {
    "start": "node &lt;FILE_TO_RUN&gt;"
}
</code></pre>

            <p>If you have defined app.listen to listen to <code>process.env.PORT</code> then you can skip the next code snippet. <br>
                 Inside your express project change <code>app.listen()</code> to the following:</p>
            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript" data-prismjs-copy="Copy to clipboard">app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, function(){
    console.log("Express server listening on port %d in %s mode", this.address().port, app.settings.env);
});
</code></pre>

            <p>This will make sure that when deployed to heroku the port will be set by heroku themselves</p>
            <p>Now make sure that the updated project is pushed to your git repos.</p>

            <p>The next step is to create the heroku app and push the git repos to it. <br>
                <code>heroku create</code> <br>
                <code>git push heroku main</code>
            </p>
            <p>The project should now get pushed to the app.</p>

            <p>In case the project is a subfolder to a git repository use the following command to push instead <br>
                <code>git subtree push --prefix &lt;PATH_TO_SUBFOLDER_PROJECT&gt; heroku master </code>
            </p>

            <p>If you need to remove the current heroku app and add a new one you can use the following commands: <br>
            <code>git remote rm heroku</code><br>
            <code>heroku git:remote -a &lt;NAME_OF_APP&gt;</code></p>
